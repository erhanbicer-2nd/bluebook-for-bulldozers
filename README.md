> *It's a finished competition.*

* Best RMSLE score on validation data from Kaggle public leaderboard is :
*0.22909*
* My RMSLE score on validation data for now is :
*0.24547*

This score is a result of just trying once. To get a quick overview on this case, i didn't spent much time on feature engineering. I've encoded all categorical features with Label Encoding and i've some categorical features which need to transform to numerical features.

- [ ] OneHotEncoding and LabelEncoding separately
- [ ] Transform some categorical feature values into numerical values
- [ ] Try different ML models
- [ ] More visualization to get an emphasis on data
